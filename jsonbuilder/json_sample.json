    "publishedDate": "2005-06",
    "description": "Since its debut in 1954, Hi and Lois, the quintessential family comic strip, has chronicled the changing (and yet unchanging) life of the American family. Hi, Lois, Chip, Dot, Ditto, and Trixie (sitting in her sunbeam) have tracked the daily life of the baby boomers and their folks, from the trials and pleasures of good old family life to the passing fancies of the day-coonskin caps to video games. Readers, who once followed the strip from Chip and Dot's angle, as kids, now see things more from Hi and Lois's point of view, as parents shepherding their own families along. For 32 years two of the great comic-strip masters of our time-Mort \"Beetle Bailey\" Walker and Dik \"Hägar the Horrible\" Browne-have worked together to make this one of the most enduringly popular and widely read strips. It appears in over 1,000 newspapers daily, and is one of the half dozen most popular strips in the world. The Best of Hi and Lois is truly the ultimate collection. With close to 300 daily strips and more than 80 Sunday pages from 1954 to present, plus special drawings and a behind-the-scenes look at how the strip is created, it forms an affectionately funny retrospective on four different decades of American family life. Hi and Lois is the result of a classic collaboration between Mort Walker, who writes the strip, and Dik Browne, who draws it. The Best of Hi and Lois completes a trilogy that presents the best of their work.",

    "description": "“Hi, can we be friends?” How have you handled this common question so far? Friendship is a journey. Strangers of yesterday can become best of friends tomorrow. However, after these strangers become casual friends, they may migrate into closer friendships. This journey for some cumulates into cordial business relationships, others into bubbling love and romance, but sadly, most of them end up in shock and regret. “I didn't know that she was that kind of person,” the guys would often say. “He was only looking for sex,” the ladies would often conclude. How do we choose friends, especially those of the opposite sex? How can we maintain godly relationships, avoid heart breaks and handle platonic friendships? Many promising relationships are destroyed for lack of intelligent foresight, misplaced ideology about male/female sexuality, and abuse of human intimacy. Hi, Can we be friends? peels out layer by layer the complex process of defining the reason why a particular guy or girl comes into your life. It empowers you to harvest the potentials of relationships while putting your excesses in check. This book provides practical answers to a growing nagging nightmare of how to stand for purity amidst a sex-hyped generation. It's practical, friendly and dynamic approach makes it a must-read for all.",
